# Simple-nn: Simple neural network implemented using numpy+scipy

These are practices I made to help gain a deeper understanding of the concepts
of inner workings of neural networks. They are certainly not as efficient and
robust as those mature implementations like **Tensorflow**, **keras**, and only
suitable for educational purposes.


## Types of networks

Each network type will have:

* One or more pieces of articles explaining the workings of the network.
* A Python implementation using `numpy` + `scipy`.
* An example application of the network.

### 1. A 5-layer dense network for hand-written digit classification

### 2. A 5-layer convolutional neural network for hand-written digit classification

### more to come

These are my personal understandings of the subject and therefore are most likely
to have mistakes. If you spot any of such, please fire an issue and let me know.
